Symlink gallery: recurse subdirectories and link sane images.

This tool checks a source directory with all its subdirectories searching 
for valid image files. If a valid image is found, a symbolic link is created 
into the destination directory.

Warning: Alpha stage, loading directory with many files could take very long.
